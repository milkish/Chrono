Chrono is a small android app that simulates a retro calculator.  It should
work out of the box in eclipse. Theres really not much else to say. It is fairly
well documented and serves as a good learning tool for Android. If you find this
project usefull and want to show some appreciation, you can pick up the app in 
the app store for $.99.
